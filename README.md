### the Lipsem Compiler Project

This is a remake of the [Lipsem programming language](https://github.com/Mespyr/lipsem) as a compiler instead of an interpreter.
Most of the lexer uses code from the [Ach programming language](https://github.com/Mespyr/ach).
*both of these languages were created by me*

LCP plans to be different in a few different ways from Lipsem. Different keywords will be used, and proper strings will be added.
