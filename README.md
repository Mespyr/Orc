# Ochre
Ochre is a stack-based programming language which compiles down to C. With a combination of both high-level and low-level features, it aims to have the simplicity of a Forth-like language while still possessing the modern features that allow an ease of development.

Look at [test/README.md](test/README.md) for an example of how the output C code will look like.
Look at [syntax/](syntax/) for an example of Ochre's syntax.
